## Time log

From project creation, figma design reconginition and development to minimum deliverable it took
me around 2 hours and 30 minutes. A little bit more fo time deploying as I had never deployed app demos.

## AI usage
I mainly used Cursor, as it worked for autocompletion. It generated the code for task completion animation and
modal design. It also used as debugger for solving issues on the road.

## TODOs & trade-offs

- Tab implementation. As it was only visual I did left it for the end but I ran out of time.
- Undo check style. As I was running out of time I used a previous design I have done previously that served a similar purpose so I did not changed mucha the design.
- Animation for remaining tasks. Time wise I was not able to implement it.
- Filter buttons.
- Drag and drop.
- Themes.
- Accessibility.
